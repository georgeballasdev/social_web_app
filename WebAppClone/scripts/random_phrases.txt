In a Pickle
A Home Bird
Like Father Like Son

On the Ropes
Go Out On a Limb
A Dog in the Manger
Eat My Hat
Mouth-watering
On Cloud Nine
Easy As Pie
On the Same Page

Every Cloud Has a Silver Lining
Right Out of the Gate

Tug of War
A Dime a Dozen
Short End of the Stick
Jaws of Life
Ugly Duckling
Hear, Hear
Love Birds
